# University projects
The purpose of this repository is to show some of the projects that I have done during my stay at the university. I only share the work I do individually.

Project list:
- #️⃣ [Tic-tac-toe using the Min-Max algorithm.](https://github.com/mandorc/university-projects/blob/main/Artificial%20Intelligence/tic-tac-toe%20using%20Mini-Max%20algorithm.md)

**Note:** This list will continue to be updated, at least until summer 2023.
