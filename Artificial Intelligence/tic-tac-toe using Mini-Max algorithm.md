# tic-tac-toe using Mini-Max algorithm
## About this project
I developed a tic-tac-toe game using the Mini-Max algorithm. The game was developed using the Java language.

When the user starts a new game, the user has the option to choose whether to play against another person or against the system itself.

The game has a score that registers the number of victories of each player.

Every time a user wins, a message like the following is displayed:

Like all my projects, they always carry a special dedication.

## Improvements I could make
- Allow the player to change characters keeping their score, in such a way that it is not the same player who starts all the games. The character change could be done manually or randomly.
- The size of the board could be changed so that it is not only 3x3.


**Note:** This project was developed using Java.
